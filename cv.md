## About Myself:

I am a beginner Front-end developer. I am well oriented in modern Front-end technologies and every day I study the possibilities of the JavaScript language. I am responsible and try to find a solution on my own. I like to work in a team because working in a team on the same task inspires me.
I am interested in web development because this field is developing rapidly, which gives the opportunity to constantly learn something new and improve professional skills.
I am looking for an internship or a job to start my career path in Front-end development.

## Skills

* HTML5, CSS3, Sass/SCSS, BEM
* Javascript (Basic)
* Git, GitHub
* Adobe XD, Figma (for developers)

## Code Example
### Count strings in objects
Create a function strCount (takes an object as argument) that will count all string values inside an object. For example:
```
strCount({
  first: "1",
  second: "2",
  third: false,
  fourth: ["anytime",2,3,4],
  fifth:  null
  })
  //returns 3
```
##### Solution

```
function strCount (obj) {
let sum = 0

for (let key in obj) {
  if (typeof obj[key] === 'string' ) {
    sum += 1
  } if (typeof obj[key] === 'object') {
    sum += strCount(obj[key])
  }
}
return sum
}
```
